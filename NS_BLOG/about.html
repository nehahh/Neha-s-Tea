        <h1>Hi there! I'm Neha ðŸ˜Š</h1>
        <div class="about">
            <p>A bit of a clumsy, short ball of energy, always embracing life with a smile. I tend to see the world with a playful, childlike wonder. Some people might think Iâ€™m carefree, but honestly, I just find happiness in the little thingsâ€”whether itâ€™s my favorite anime or a simple moment with my camera, there's joy everywhere if you look for it.</p>

            <p>My schooling has played a huge role in shaping who I am today. I started off at St. Joseph's School (CBSE) in Jayalakshmipuram, Mysuru, where I built the foundation for my love of learning. After that, I studied at Gopalaswamy Shishuvihara High School & Pre-University College (Sankalpa) for PU. Now, Iâ€™m pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering at Vidyavardhaka College of Engineering in Mysore. Itâ€™s been an exciting journey filled with both academic growth and personal development.</p>

            <p>Speaking Marathi, my mother tongue, brings me immense comfortâ€”it feels like a little piece of home wherever I am. Anime, especially shows like Jujutsu Kaisen and One Piece, plays a huge part in my life. These stories inspire me and keep my creativity alive, fueling my imagination in ways nothing else does. Alongside my love for anime, photography holds a special place in my heart. I particularly enjoy snapping pictures of my adorable gully dogs. Itâ€™s a reminder for me to slow down and capture the beauty in the little moments.</p>

            <p>When it comes to my height, yes, Iâ€™m short! People used to make fun of me, but Iâ€™ve moved past that. Now, Iâ€™m often the first to crack a joke about my height. Itâ€™s become a fun part of who I am, and I embrace it. Being clumsy and short just adds to my charm!</p>

            <p>With humor, curiosity, and love for embracing my quirks, lifeâ€™s been a wonderful adventure, and I wouldnâ€™t have it any other way.</p>
